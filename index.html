    <!-- Boo -->
    <p>
      Welcome to my little corner of the web, where I’m finally taking the leap into something I’ve been drawn to for years but never quite stuck with. For as long as I can remember, I’ve admired the artistry behind good design and the creativity it takes to bring ideas to life. Despite this interest, I struggled to find the momentum to dive deep into coding, often stopping before I even started.

      This website is my canvas and my progress log—a space to document the highs and lows of learning, to share the projects I create, and to remind myself (and hopefully others) that it’s never too late to start again. Whether you’re here to follow my journey or find inspiration for your own, I’m glad you stopped by!
